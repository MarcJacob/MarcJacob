Hi ! My name is Marc Jacob, a developper with passion on all things related to video-game development.

My main expertise is in C / C++ Real-time Programming, with a specialization in using the Unreal Engine. I also have experience using Unity and C#, and spend a lot of time working on engine-less projects as well.

Current personal project is a collaborative graph-based intellectual construction software.

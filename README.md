Hi ! My name is Marc Jacob, a developper with passion on all things related to video-game development.

I bid you welcome to my Github profile ! On here I post most of my projects that I believe worth showing by themselves. As a Programmer by trade, my main focus is nearly always
the accomplishment of some technical feat I've never done before - be it some sort of AI, broad optimization, using GPU computing... Every project on here will have one such an element of uniqueness on a technical standpoint from what I've done before.

My main expertise is in C / C++ Game Programming, with a specialization in using the Unreal Engine. I also have experience using Unity and C#, and spend a lot of time working on engine-less projects as well.

This GitHub account was left to gather dust between the years ~2021 and late 2024, I am in the process of cleaning it up and will be using it for my latest pet project.

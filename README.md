Hi ! My name is Marc Jacob, a developper with passion on all things related to video-game development.

My main expertise is in C / C++ Game Programming, with a specialization in using the Unreal Engine. I also have experience using Unity and C#, and spend a lot of time working on engine-less projects as well.

Currently I am attempting to learn how to program on Embedded Platforms, possibly in the hopes of a career change at some point into Robotics or the Defense or Aerospatial industries.

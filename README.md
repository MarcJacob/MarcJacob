Hi ! My name is Marc Jacob, a developper with passion on all things related to video-game development.

My main expertise is in C / C++ Game Programming, with a specialization in using the Unreal Engine. I also have experience using Unity and C#, and spend a lot of time working on engine-less projects as well.

This GitHub account was left to gather dust between the years ~2021 and late 2024, I am in the process of cleaning it up and will be using it for my latest pet project.

Hi ! My name is Marc Jacob, 22 (born 17/11/1998), from Lyon, France.

I bid you welcome to my Github profile ! On here I post most of my projects that I believe worth showing by themselves. As a Programmer by trade, my main focus is nearly always
the accomplishment of some technical feat I've never done before - be it some sort of AI, broad optimization, using GPU computing... Every project on here will have one such
element of uniqueness on a technical standpoint from what I've done before.

My core expertise is C# programming using the Unity Engine - it has been my tool of choice ever since I started seriously spending time on game programming when I was 15.
Currently, and for more than a year now I've been looking to massively expand my horizon *downwards*, studying lower level programming (mainly memory management), non-OOP
architecture and understanding how to use my (and my players') computers more holistically : from CPU / RAM to CPU / Caches <-> RAM + Networking + GPU would sum up my recent
evolution as a programmer, broadly speaking.

Currently unemployed, I am working on a yet-unannounced project with my brother (github.com/Permilias) while looking for a job. My priority is finding a place where I can learn
and be taken under the wing of more experienced peers - and work on more technically challenging projects than simple Unity SP gameplay programming like in my previous job.
